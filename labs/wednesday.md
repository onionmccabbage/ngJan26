## Testing with Playwright
* Individually or in groups, use Playwright to implement end to end tests for either of the previous labs
* If you wish to develop further features, try test-driven-development

There will be an opportunity to talk us through what you built. Thinking and implementations are key 
There may be stand-up reports during the lab

* Try writing some user stories the nimplment these as end to end tests
* See if there is any opportunity to implement beforeEach or beforeAll

##### Service
* You should be able to use your services as-provided, but consider implementing mock service data

##### Architecture
* Treat these tests as if they will end up in a continuous integration scenario 
* When you have some passing tests, implement another feature (e.g. city and country for weather) and ensure the tests still pass

##### Data retrieval
* Test for failures and other edge cases
